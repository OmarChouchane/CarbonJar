## API Documentation

- Live docs: visit `/api-docs` when the dev server is running.
- Spec file: `openapi.yml` (OpenAPI 3.1). Start with health, contact requests, and trainings. Expand as routes stabilize.
- Static UI: `public/swagger.html` is embedded via an iframe for React 19 compatibility.

Local run

- Start app: `npm run dev` (then open http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
- Edit `openapi.yml`, refresh the page to see updates.
